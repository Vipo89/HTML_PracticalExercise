## Project Info

This is just a **class project**, created as a practice exercise.  

- It does **not include a responsive design**.  
- The goal was to practice building a **web page structure** with:  
  - A `header`  
  - A `main` section containing **6 different sections**  
  - A `footer`  
- This project was meant to explore layout, HTML structure, and basic CSS animations, not to create a full production-ready website.

## Installation / How to Use

1. Clone or download the project:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vipo89/HTML_PracticalExercise
